        <h4><em>(President)</em></h4>
        <h4><em>1977 - Mech</em></h4>

        <p>


          Beginning with three branches and limited faculties, Government Engineering College, Bilaspur has
          now become a premier institute offering prestigious degrees for under-graduates as well as
          post-graduates. The institute aims to shape the achievers of future and equip them with all the
          required skills and top class capabilities to shine in their chosen field. It gives me immense
          satisfaction that our Institution is able to contribute to society by producing capable students who
          are given sound professional training, besides enlightened by inculcating moral values in them.</p>
        <p>
          Spreading education among masses is perhaps the greatest gift one can give to society. It enlightens
          and empowers people, humanizes them and gives meaning to their existence, thereby bringing peace and
          prosperity in the society and makes this universe more live-able. Government Engineering College,
          Bilaspur offers the best of infrastructure, libraries stocked with standard books, creative project
          facilities and an enabling and interacting environment for learning.

        </p>


        <p>
          Time is a limited resource. If the students have the ambition to make a mark in any field the only
          way is to choose the right direction and strive to achieve the goal. I look forward to the
          continuous and harmonious development through care, compassion and concern so that students may go
          out in the world to glitter and glow. I wish all students a bright academic future, an illustrious
          career, and happy life.

        <p>
          ASK - Always Seek Knowledge. There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge... observation
          of nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reflection combines them;
          experimentation verifies the results of that combination. I wish the most effective of fortune,
          peace, and prosperity to all or any people who contribute to the noble task of spreading education
          and its manifest qualities, aims, and objectives. Success for all students is ensured at our
          institute by the delivery of an enriching, child-centered, balanced, and structured curriculum and a
          full institute specialize in student welfare that focuses on the positive recognition of student
          achievements. During this age of globalization, survival without new learning is unthinkable. So, we
          must not ever forget to encourage every effort of the youngsters to enhance their every act of
          generosity and honesty and celebrate even the tiniest of achievements.
        </p>

        <p>
          The world around us is continually changing and that we are aware that there are many challenges
          that lie before us as we navigate around this world of adjusting demands. We plan the moon, we all
          know that whether or not we miss, we are going to land somewhere among the celebs. The requirement
          of the hour is to collaborate, innovate, and continue to grow so as to stay pace with the changes
          that are inevitable. Education and training today are to be aligned and geared to satisfy these
          remarkable challenges.
        </p>


        <p>
          I also encourage and promote research activities and integrate them with the teaching-learning
          process. We believe lifelong learning and training, resulting in the benefits of society. Our core
          values of data, character, excellence, integrity, transparency, quality, teamwork, execution with
          passion, trust, and continuous and student-centric learning are all closely integrated into our
          academic programmes.

          In an era of firm competition, success can only be achieved if one makes the right kind of effort at
          the right time. I am happy to note that Government Engineering College, Bilaspur, is following the
          ideals of integrated learning by giving opportunities to students to develop their personality
          through different co-curricular as well as extracurricular activities and soft skill courses. An
          important component of academic excellence is remarkable faculty who teach with skill and passion.
        </p>

        <p>
          I seek to foster increased engagement among students, parents, teachers, and policy makers to not
          only help youth achieve their highest potential but also to raise the happiness and fulfillment
          index. We provide personalized, top grade education delivered by an experienced and well-qualified
          faculty who bring an intellectual rigor and practical focus to their classrooms. We draw students
          from diverse and multi-cultural backgrounds, which provide a very vibrant and stimulating college
          environment.

        <p>
          Our efforts also are enhanced by the vital involvement of inspirational alumni, who are doing
          innovative and transformative things in their personal and professional lives and serve as shining
          examples for our society. They are making their marks on just about every profession and walk of
          life imaginable—proof that an engineering degree can lead to great things.
